üõçÔ∏è Fashion Retail Sales Analysis ‚Äî Power BI Dashboard
Project Overview
This repository features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to provide actionable insights into the sales performance of a fashion retail business. The dashboard visualizes key metrics, identifies sales trends, highlights top-performing products, and pinpoints peak sales periods, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, marketing, and operational strategies.


üéØ Objectives
The main objectives of this project were to:

Analyze the overall purchase amount and identify key sales drivers.
Understand daily and monthly sales patterns to identify peak performance periods.
Determine the busiest days of the week and months of the year for sales.
Identify the top-selling products based on purchase volume.
Analyze product performance based on customer review ratings.

üóÇÔ∏è Data Source
The dashboard is powered by a dataset containing fashion retail sales transactions. This dataset includes information such as:

Purchase Amount
Order Dates
Product Categories/Items Purchased (e.g., Tunics, Jeans, Skirts)

Customer Review Ratings
(If you have a sample data file or schema, you can mention it here, e.g., "The sample data used for this dashboard is available in fashion_retail.csv.")


üìå Key Insights
Based on the dashboard visualizations (as of the provided screenshot, covering OCT 2022 - OCT 2023), some key insights include:

Total Purchase Amount: A significant 362K USD in purchases was recorded during the analyzed period.
Busiest Days of the Week: Sales are consistently higher on Weekdays, with Monday and Thursday showing particularly strong performance.
Busiest Months: The months of May and December experience the maximum number of orders.
Monthly Sales Trend: While showing fluctuations, the monthly trend for total orders peaked at 36.6K in December, indicating strong year-end sales.

Top 5 Items Purchased:

Tunic (17.7%)

Jeans (16.95%)

Gloves (19.76%)

Boots (18.68%)

Slippers (17.07%)

Top 5 Review Rating Items Purchased:


Skirt (21.58%)

Shorts (18.4%)

Tank Top (20.2%)

Belt (19.99%)

Pants (20.16%)

üìà Power BI Visualizations

The dashboard utilizes a variety of interactive visualizations to present these insights:

Summary Cards: For key metrics like "Purchase Amount".

Bar Chart: "Daily Trend for Total Orders" to show performance across weekdays.

Line/Area Chart: "Monthly Trend for Total Orders" to visualize seasonal and monthly sales patterns.
Donut Charts:

"Top 5 Item Purchased" to show the distribution of top-selling products.

"Top 5 Review Rating Items purchased" to highlight products with high customer satisfaction.
Slicers: For dynamic filtering by "Item Purchased" and "Date Range" (e.g., "OCT 2022 - OCT 2023").

üõ† Tools Used
Power BI Desktop: The primary tool for data modeling, transformation, and creating interactive visualizations.
Microsoft Excel / CSV: Likely used for initial data storage or preprocessing.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns and measures to derive deeper insights (e.g., total purchase amount, percentages for donut charts).

This is a powerBi end to end project
